Human-dates
===========

This package is the result of the repackaging of the original `human-dates
<https://github.com/jtushman/human_dates>`_, that it's coming itself from a
`Stack Overflow answer <http://stackoverflow.com/a/1551394/192791>`_ citing a
further source, not available anymore.

maintain a lengthy barely useful function, but that you would like to have the
same if provided by someone else).
